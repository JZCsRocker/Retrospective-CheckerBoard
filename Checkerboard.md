1. I think I did well for the chellenge and I met all the requirements. The main difference between my work and what was posted in the
solution is in the UIController. We use different way to define the UI. The hard thing to do the chellenge is to be familiar with fxml 
because I did not use it recently. So the start is a little bit hard.

2. When I begin to work on the chellenge, it took me lots of time to be familiar with these programming concepts and knowledge. But I think I understood them well when I did the chellenge so I can get the correct result.

3. I think I met all the requirements.

4. My solution is very similar to the posted solution and just the sizes of UI are different.

5. The posted solution definded the UI in a very clear and concise way. What I need to improve is to learn how to write code in that 
way and make the code more efficient. I think I have understand all the requirements in the chellenge.
